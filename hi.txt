Nancy Drew: The Most Likely Killer of Sherlock Holmes
In the Sherlock Holmes murder mystery game, the given story provides several clues that point to Nancy Drew as the one who had the strongest motive, the best opportunity, and the means to kill Sherlock Holmes. Let's analyze each aspect in detail.

1. Nancy’s Motive: Jealousy, Resentment, and Betrayal
Nancy Drew had deep-seated resentment toward Sherlock Holmes, which served as a powerful motive for his murder. The story reveals:

Nancy felt overshadowed by Sherlock Holmes. She believed she had contributed just as much to solving cases but was treated as a mere footnote in his victories.
Sherlock took all the credit. Despite standing beside him, uncovering clues, and even helping him survive dangerous situations, Holmes alone was celebrated.
Her anger was intense. The story states: "Nancy Drew had never felt rage like this before." This suggests her emotions were strong enough to drive her to drastic actions.
She knew exactly who was to blame. The narrative explicitly says that she was aware of who caused her downfall—Sherlock Holmes.
This overwhelming feeling of being erased, unappreciated, and ignored fueled Nancy’s desire for revenge.

2. Nancy’s Opportunity: Sherlock’s Trust in Her
The story highlights that Nancy had something Moriarty never did—Sherlock’s trust.
Because Holmes saw her as a friend and ally, he never suspected her betrayal.
This trust gave Nancy an advantage—she could get close to Sherlock without raising any alarms, making it easier to carry out the murder.
Even Moriarty acknowledges this:
"He still sees you as an ally," Moriarty mused. "That gives us the perfect advantage."
Sherlock’s greatest mistake was not seeing Nancy as a threat, which gave her the perfect opening to kill him.

3. Nancy’s Means: Teaming Up with Moriarty
Nancy didn’t act alone—she joined forces with James Moriarty, Sherlock’s arch-nemesis.

She willingly met with Moriarty. She received an invitation with only four words: "We need to talk."
She accepted Moriarty’s proposal. Instead of refusing, she saw him as someone who understood what it was like to be overshadowed and forgotten.
She made the first move.
When discussing Sherlock’s downfall, Nancy leaned forward and whispered:
"Destroy Sherlock Holmes from the inside."
This clearly indicates that she actively planned his downfall, rather than being manipulated by Moriarty.
By working with Moriarty, she had the resources, knowledge, and planning necessary to execute the murder.

4. The Final Act: Nancy Delivered the Killing Blow
The last section of the story confirms that Nancy was the actual killer.

She was the one who killed Sherlock Holmes with her own hands.
Moriarty may have planned it, but Nancy delivered the final blow.
This means that while Moriarty may have orchestrated the scheme, Nancy was the one who physically carried out the murder.

5. Why Not Moriarty?
While Moriarty is the classic villain in Sherlock Holmes’ stories, he:

Had always been Holmes' enemy—Sherlock was wary of him and expected him to strike.
Lacked the element of trust—Holmes would never have let his guard down around Moriarty.
Did not personally kill Sherlock—The story confirms that Nancy, not Moriarty, delivered the final blow.
Thus, Moriarty may have been the mastermind, but Nancy was the executioner.

Final Verdict: Nancy Drew is the Killer
Nancy had everything required to commit the perfect murder:

Motive → Deep resentment and jealousy toward Sherlock.
Opportunity → She had Sherlock’s trust, allowing her to get close without suspicion.
Means → She teamed up with Moriarty, ensuring she had support.
Final Confirmation → The story directly states she delivered the final blow.
The world mourned Sherlock Holmes’ death, never realizing that his closest ally was the one who betrayed him. In the end, only Nancy and Moriarty knew the truth.
